<h3>Merge Sort</h3>
The basic steps of a d&c algorithm can be boiled down to these three steps:<br><br>

<strong>Divide</strong> and break up the problem into the smallest possible “subproblem”, of the exact same type.<br><br>
<strong>Conquer</strong> and tackle the smallest subproblems first. Once you’ve figured out a solution that works, use that exact same technique to solve the larger subproblems — in other words, solve the subproblems recursively.<br><br>
<strong>Combine</strong> the answers and build up the smaller subproblems until you finally end up applying the same solution to the larger, more complicated problem that you started off with!<br><br>
